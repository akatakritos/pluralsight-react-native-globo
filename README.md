# React Native Learning

Started with the demo app from a pluralsight course, then started making enhancements to try different things out.

## Enhancements

1. Use typescript
1. Use hooks instead of class components used in the videos
1. Refactor auth code to own shared service
1. Introduce some FP concepts with discriminated unions
1. Try out rxjs as a shared state store (current user). Redux would be the more common alternative
1. Upgrade to latest navigator version. Add some typescript customizations
